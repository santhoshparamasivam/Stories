The hare was very fast on his feet. He took part in many races, and always came first, no matter who the opponent was. Over time, his constant victory turned him into a very proud hare. He began to put in lesser effort in the races he took part in because he was winning them all anyway. Now, in the same forest, was a wise tortoise. Unlike the hare, the tortoise was extremely slow. In fact, he was one of the slowest animals in the jungle. He kept observing the hare, and he saw that the hare’s success was getting to his head. So he decided to teach the hare a lesson. "

But they all were curious, and the hare loved a challenge. So he accepted it."
