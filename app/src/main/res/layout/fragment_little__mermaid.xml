She longed to be human, and when she ended up rescuing a handsome prince from drowning, she decided that she must become human at any cost as she wanted to be with him. This led her to visit a sea witch and exchanged her voice for a pair of human legs. When she presented herself before the prince, he did not recognise her as the girl who saved him. In the Disney version, despite all odds, the little mermaid and her prince defeat the sea witch and are able to get married and live happily ever after."
